# bioregistry-impact

why are we doing this?
to make it possible to assess which ontologies are using ODK, and transitively, are using Bioregistry.

later: mine publications for mentions of ontologies, then make the case that X number
of publications are using Bioregistry. This is sort of being done as part of Bioregistry's
literature pipeline, but this should be re-organized to be a set of pubmed searches
for each ontology name.

alternative: bioregistry has publications listed for each ontology, try and find who
cites them.

later later: connect publications to authors/institutions to show which countries are
publishing on Bioregistry
